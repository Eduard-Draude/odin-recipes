# odin-recipes
I'm at the "Project: Recipes" pages in "The Odin Project" and got the task to create my own website
The Task ist to create recipe page content and create a basic site (tho it says it does not have to be pretty)
Later we will improve it and make it beautiful i hope

I will add links, images and a basic structure to the site
